## Customer_Churn_Prediction_SunbaseData_Project ##

* The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with all the codes ('Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb').
* A dataset containing details of about 100K customers with 7 independent features and 1 dependent feature is analyzed thoroughly by using data analysis and data visualization built-in libraries in Python like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. After meticulous data cleaning and data preprocessing, machine learning models like logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, naive Bayes, and SVM, and deep learning neural networks are implemented to learn insights and intricate patterns from the data and become capable of predicting the churn. The performance of different models is assessed through various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1- score.
* The report explains the Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization, Model Implementation, Model Evaluation, and finally the Conclusion.
* The 'Churn_Dataset.xlsx' contains the data used in this project. It can be downloaded.
* 'Predict_Churn.pkl' is a pickle file that contains the best-performing model.
